# Completed-Projects
Repository of completed projects/school work/"finished" code.

All files within thie repository are school projects I have worked on that I was able to publish. I have other more complex projects in their own repositories, please refer back to https://github.com/Nate-Wilcox


Note: 
  - CheckingApplication.cpp is meant to be run with both Checking Account.h and CheckingAccount.cpp.
  - There are a few programs that require files to run that I no longer have as they were school projects and were using files only provided by that school.
Please see Works in progress to see my current project!

To get a good understanding of my coding ability I would direct you to look at the battleship.c file, the Checking Account files or the war.c file as those are the programs I am most proud of.
