# Completed-Projects
Repository of completed projects/school work/"finished" code.
Note: 
  - CheckingApplication.cpp is meant to be run with both Checking Account.h and CheckingAccount.cpp.
  - There are a few programs that require files to run that I no longer have as they were school projects and were using files only provided by that school.
Please see Works in progress to see my current project!

To get a good understanding of my coding ability I would direct you to look at the battleship.c file, the Checking Account files or the war.c file as those are the programs I am most proud of.
